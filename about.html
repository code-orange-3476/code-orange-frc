							<h3> Who are we? </h3>
							<p>
								Team Code Orange #3476 is a high-school robotics team from Irvine, California. We compete in a robotics league under an organization called <i>FIRST</i>.

							<h3> What is Code Orange's History? </h3>
							<p>
								Our team was founded in April 2010 by an interested parent.  The team gathered several mentors and a small band of students from a diverse range of backgrounds.  At our first competition in 2011, the judges recognized Code Orange's unique dynamics and presented us with a commemorative award.  The addition of a new engineering mentor, coupled with lessons learned from the previous year, resulted in a robust, effective robot for the 2012 game challenge that won not only a prestigious engineering award, but also the regional competition itself.

							<h3> What else do we do? </h3>
							<p>
								Code Orange is dedicated to inspiring others.  To do this, we participate in many outreach events, in which we often demonstrate our robots.  This is an effective way to engage both children and adults, allowing us to share with them the story of FIRST and what we have learned about science and technology through it.  In less than 4 years, we have reached out to over 7,000 kids.
