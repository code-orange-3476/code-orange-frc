					<h2>Code Orange 3476 - teamcodeorange.com</h2>
					</a>
					<p>
						The Code Orange website does not utilize third party themes or drag and drop templates. It was built from ground up by students of Code Orange with some mentor guidance, mainly using HTML5/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery. We believe that like other areas of FIRST, website creation should be a learning process for all involved students, with hands on experience being the most beneficial, thus chose <i>not</i> to implement pre-existing content management systems that simplify upkeeping significantly but take away from the key coding experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						The website was designed to be fully responsive, with optimized experiences for phones, tablets as well as traditional browsers. The site is cross-browser compatible, supporting all major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, IE(8+) and Safari, as well as their mobile counterparts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of the design work was conducted using Photoshop, and the website itself was created in Dreamweaver. Code and most content are managed through Github, then deployed through FTPloy to a Web-Hosting.com server, interfacing through cPanel. XAMPP is used to test pages locally, emulating devices through Chrome and then testing across all available device platforms.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following libraries were forked and heavily customized to provide for a superior experience:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/">
							Snap.js
							</a>
							for fluid menu drawer framework support
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/">
							Nicescroll
							</a>
							for enhancing scrolling and styling scrollbars on desktop
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://ytchannelembed.com/">
							YT Channel Embed
							</a>
							for enhancing youtube video and channel embeds
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">
							Ninja Slider
